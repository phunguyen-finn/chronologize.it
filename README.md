Get in, we're going back in time! 

<b>chronologize.it</b> is an interactive journey through history that will keep you engaged. Whether youâ€™re fascinated by the evolution of art, the rise of industrialization, or anything in between, <b>chronologize.it</b> brings the past to life. This interactive platform lets you explore detailed timelines and immerse yourself in the events that shaped our world.

Born on September 2nd, Vietnam's Independence Day, this web application was inspired by a simple idea: timelines. During my visits to museums, I realized that timelines are a fascinating way to uncover the layers of history and understand the world better. Timelines reveal connections. Timelines answer. I created <b>chronologize.it</b> to share this discovery with others, hoping it becomes a tool for everyone to learn something new every day.

## Future development

- [ ] Import timeline
- [ ] Create custom timeline
- [ ] Users
- [ ] Experiment with Gemini
